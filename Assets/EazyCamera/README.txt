Eazy Camera Readme



To set up the Eazy Camera system:
1) Add the EazyCam and EazyController components to a camera in the scene, or drag and drop the EazyCam prefab into an existing scene.
2) Assign a target for the camera to follow to the field "Follow Target" in the EazyCam component's inspector
3) Add Objects to the Layer "CameraStatic" to allow for camera collisions with the environment
4) Make sure you have a keyboard/mouse or gamepad in use

Done! Your Eazy Camera system is now ready to use. 

To see and change the controls, check out EazyController.cs
